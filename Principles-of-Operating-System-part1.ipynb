    "- Process: Create, destroy, change a process's priority, provide interprocess communication and process synchronization\n",
    "- Memory: directly request additional memory, indirectly request memory, freee memory back to os and request memory for shared among processes\n",
    "- I/O device: open, read, write, close and release, provide exclusive access for appropriate devices and various special functions\n",
    "- File system: open, read, write, close, seek a random place within a file, read file metadata, modify metadata\n",
    "- Security: set and query security policies, authenticate themselves to a remote system, listen a remote system to authenticate itself, encrypt and decrypt messages.\n",
    "- Network: establish, listen and close a connection from/to a remote system, send and receive messages from/to a remote system.\n",

    "- First Come First Served\n",
    "- Shortest Job First\n",
    "- Round-Robin(time sharing stategy, a process's time slice can end in in three ways: time slice expired, another process is granted the CPU and ready to run, and blocked), to the first two ways, we call the process preempted operation, the time-sharing analog of first-come, first-served is a policy we call round-robin. The preempted process are added to the tail of the queue just as a new processes\n",

    "## Deadlock\n",
    "Dealing with deadlock: ignore deadlock, deteck deadlock, prevent deadlock and avoid deadlock. The Banker's Algorithm shows how to avoid deadlock:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Banker's algorithm, sometimes referred to as the avoidance algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an \"s-state\" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm was developed in the design process for the THE operating system and originally described (in Dutch) in EWD108.[1] When a new process enters a system, it must declare the maximum number of instances of each resource type that it may ever claim; clearly, that number may not exceed the total number of resources in the system. Also, when a process gets all its requested resources it must return them in a finite amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Banker's algorithm to work, it needs to know three things:\n",
    "```\n",
    "How much of each resource each process could possibly request[MAX]\n",
    "How much of each resource each process is currently holding[ALLOCATED]\n",
    "How much of each resource the system currently has available[AVAILABLE]\n",
    "Resources may be allocated to a process only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "```\n",
    "request â‰¤ available, else process waits until resources are available.\n",
